# A script picks up random posts from reddit

## Linux
The only required library is base36 install it using `pip3 install base36` and you are ready. Now you can run code with `python3 random_reddit.py`

## Windows
Download exe and run it

If you see a page that says "Whoa There Partner" after you oppened link it means you runned it too long or too many times and you need to wait a few minutes before running code again.

Also its boring to click links one by one. Install browser extension called Multiple Url Opener and make sure you selected "do not load tabs until selected" option.
